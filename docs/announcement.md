# Announcing MCP for WooCommerce — WooCommerce MCP Server for WordPress

MCP for WooCommerce turns your WordPress + WooCommerce site into a WooCommerce MCP Server. It exposes standardized, read‑only tools to MCP clients over STDIO and an HTTP JSON‑RPC 2.0 streamable endpoint with JWT.

Highlights:
- WooCommerce‑focused tools (products, variations, categories, tags, attributes, reviews, shipping, payments, taxes)
- WordPress content tools (posts/pages) with permalinks
- Read‑only by design; no customer/order PII
- Easy integration with Claude, VS Code MCP, and custom clients
- Webtalkbot integration for a WooCommerce AI Chatbot/Agent
