# Woo MCP — WooCommerce for AI

[![docs](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp/actions/workflows/gh-pages.yml) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp)](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp/releases) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp)](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp/blob/main/LICENSE) [![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp?style=social)](https://github.com/iOSDevSK/woo-mcp/stargazers)

**Connect your WooCommerce store to AI assistants like Claude and VS Code.** This WordPress plugin enables AI clients to access your store's product catalog, categories, reviews, and content through a secure, read-only interface.

[Woo MCP](https://woo-mcp.com) transforms your WordPress site into an AI-accessible data source built on [Automattic's official WordPress MCP](https://github.com/Automattic/wordpress-mcp). It safely exposes public store information—products, categories, tags, reviews, shipping options, and WordPress content—while protecting customer data and private details.

Perfect for building AI-powered shopping assistants or integrating with custom AI applications.

## Key Features

- Read-only access: all tools are type "read" (no writes)
- Product/variation permalinks: every product/variation includes a `permalink` field (must be shown in AI responses)
- Dual transports: STDIO (WordPress style) and Streamable HTTP (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- JWT authentication: secure token access, with optional local-development mode
- Admin UI: settings page with tool toggles and automated proxy generation for Claude Desktop when JWT is disabled
- WooCommerce focus: intelligent search, categories, tags, attributes, reviews, shipping, payments, taxes, system status
- WordPress content: posts and pages with permalinks

## Why Choose Woo MCP

- WooCommerce MCP Server: turnkey MCP server for WooCommerce + WordPress.
- WordPress MCP Plugin: install, toggle tools, authenticate, and connect any MCP client.
- AI Chatbot/Agent: integrate with chat platforms to deploy on-site assistance in minutes.
- Read-only and safe: no PII; tools return permalinks for clickable product links.
- Works with Claude, VS Code MCP, MCP Inspector, custom MCP clients.

## Architecture and Endpoints

- STDIO transport (WordPress format)
  - Endpoint: `/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp`
  - Auth: JWT if required, or unauthenticated read-only if JWT is disabled in settings
  - Usage: broad client compatibility via `@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote` proxy

- Streamable HTTP transport (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  - Endpoint: `/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp/streamable`
  - Auth: JWT (recommended for direct integration)
  - Benefits: lower latency, no proxy needed, modern MCP
  - OpenAPI: `/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp/openapi.json`

Tip: If you’re searching for “WooCommerce MCP Server endpoint”, this is it. Use the Streamable HTTP transport for modern, low-latency clients.

## Documentation Site

- Browse the documentation site (after GitHub Pages is enabled): `https://iosdevsk.github.io/woo-mcp/`
- Quick links:
  - What is WooCommerce MCP Server? `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/what-is.md`
  - Install: `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/install.md`
  - Configure: `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/configure.md`
  - Examples: `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/examples.md`
  - Troubleshooting: `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/troubleshooting.md`
  - FAQ: `docs/woocommerce-mcp-server/faq.md`

## Admin Settings

- Location: Settings > Woo MCP
- Core toggles:
  - Enable MCP functionality: master on/off for the plugin
  - Require JWT Authentication: enforce JWT for MCP endpoints
    - When disabled, the plugin can act as a local Claude Desktop connector. It automatically generates a proxy script file.
- Tools: enable/disable individual tools (states stored in the `wordpress_mcp_tool_states` option)

Note: The settings page is a React UI (assets in `build/`).

## Authentication and Clients

- JWT tokens
  - Generate/manage from the admin UI (Authentication Tokens)
  - Best practice: rotate tokens, use short expirations for production

- Claude Code (direct HTTP + JWT)
```
claude mcp add --transport http \
  woo-mcp https://your-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp/streamable \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT"
```

- Claude Desktop via proxy (recommended for STDIO)
```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "woo-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote@latest"],
      "env": {
        "WP_API_URL": "https://your-site.com",
        "JWT_TOKEN": "YOUR_JWT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- VS Code MCP Extension (direct Streamable + JWT)
```
{
  "servers": {
    "woo-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-site.com/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp/streamable",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT" }
    }
  }
}
```

- MCP Inspector (testing)
```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  -e WP_API_URL=https://your-site.com \
  -e JWT_TOKEN=YOUR_JWT \
  npx @automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote@latest
```

### Automatic local proxy generation (when JWT is disabled)

- When you toggle “Require JWT Authentication” OFF in Settings > Woo MCP, the plugin automatically generates a Claude Desktop-friendly MCP proxy script at:
  - `wp-content/plugins/woo-mcp/mcp-proxy.js` (executable, Node.js)
- The UI also surfaces ready-to-copy Claude Desktop config JSON. Additionally, a PHP proxy file ships with the plugin (`mcp-proxy.php`) if you prefer PHP:
```
// Node (uses generated mcp-proxy.js)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "woocommerce": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/wp-content/plugins/woo-mcp/mcp-proxy.js"]
    }
  }
}

// PHP (ships with the plugin)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "woocommerce": {
      "command": "php",
      "args": ["/wp-content/plugins/woo-mcp/mcp-proxy.php"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best-Practice Product Search Workflow

1. Use `wc_products_search` first to find products by name/description
2. Use `wc_get_product` with the returned ID for details
3. Use `wc_get_product_variations` (or `wc_get_product_variation`) for variations
4. Always include clickable `permalink` links for products and variations

## Registered Tools (read-only)

  - `wc_products_search` — primary universal search (includes `permalink`)
  - `wc_get_product` — product by ID (includes `permalink`)

- Reviews
  - `wc_get_product_reviews` — list reviews with filters/pagination
  - `wc_get_product_review` — single review by ID

## Integration Examples

Connect various AI platforms to your WooCommerce data.

Prerequisites:
- Woo MCP installed and enabled
- JWT token generated in WordPress Admin (Settings > Woo MCP)
- Your chosen AI platform or chatbot service

Common integration patterns:

**API Endpoint Integration:**
- Use streamable endpoint: `/wp-json/wp/v2/wpmcp/streamable`
- Include JWT token in Authorization header
- Follow JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for requests

**Chat Platform Setup:**
- Configure platform to use MCP endpoint  
- Provide your WordPress site URL
- Authenticate with generated JWT token
- Example platforms: Webtalkbot, custom chatbots, AI assistants

**Best practices:**
- Test with common customer questions
- Ensure product links are included in responses
- Monitor API usage and performance
- Keep JWT tokens secure and rotate regularly

## Security

- JWT: signature validation, expiration, easy rotation
- JWT disabled mode: read-only access plus a generated local proxy script for Claude Desktop
- Never commit tokens; use HTTPS; rotate frequently
- Tool toggles: disable tools you don’t want exposed
- No customer PII is exposed; focus is on public store data and WP content

## Troubleshooting

- “WooCommerce functions not available”: ensure WooCommerce is active
- “Insufficient permissions”: with JWT required, admin capabilities are needed (e.g., `manage_woocommerce`)
- `wc_intelligent_search` returns no products: the tool suggests alternatives; try a less restrictive query
- Admin UI issues: run `npm install && npm run build` in the plugin directory

AI Assistant Tips (best practice):
- Always start with `wc_products_search`, then `wc_get_product` for details
- Never hardcode product IDs; use IDs returned from search
- Always include clickable `permalink` links in user-facing answers
